    "- The leave-one-out cross-validation procedure is appropriate when you have a small dataset or when an accurate estimate of model performance is more important than the computational cost of the method.\n",

    "Cross-validation, or k-fold cross-validation, is a procedure used to estimate the performance of a machine learning algorithm when making predictions on data not used during the training of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cross-validation has a single hyperparameter “k” that controls the number of subsets that a dataset is split into. Once split, __each subset is given the opportunity to be used as a test set while all other subsets together are used as a training dataset__.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Leave-one-out cross-validation|__, or LOOCV, is a configuration of k-fold cross-validation where k is set to the number of examples in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "LOOCV is an extreme version of k-fold cross-validation that has the maximum computational cost. It requires one model to be created and evaluated for each example in the training dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "__The benefit of so many fit and evaluated models is a more robust estimate of model performance as each row of data is given an opportunity to represent the entirety of the test dataset__.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the computational cost, LOOCV is __not appropriate for very large datasets such as more than tens or hundreds of thousands of examples__, or for models that are costly to fit, such as neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Don’t Use LOOCV__: Large datasets or costly models to fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, __given that no sampling of the training dataset is used, this estimation procedure is deterministic__, unlike train-test splits and other k-fold cross-validation confirmations that provide a stochastic estimate of model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Use LOOCV__: Small datasets or when estimated model performance is critical."
