    "In this tutorial you are going to learn about the Naive Bayes algorithm including how it works and how to implement it from scratch in Python (__without libraries__).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use probability to make predictions in machine learning. Perhaps the most widely used example is called the Naive Bayes algorithm. Not only is it straightforward to understand, but it also achieves surprisingly good results on a wide range of problems.\n",

    "After completing this tutorial you will know:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to calculate the probabilities required by the Naive Bayes algorithm.\n",

    "## Naive Bayes\n",
    "Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm for binary (two-class) and multiclass classification problems. It is called Naive Bayes or idiot Bayes because the calculations of the probabilities for each class are simplified to make their calculations tractable.\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(class|data) = (P(data|class) * P(class)) / P(data)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than attempting to calculate the probabilities of each attribute value, they are assumed to be conditionally independent given the class value.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very strong assumption that is most unlikely in real data, i.e. that the attributes do not interact. Nevertheless, the approach performs surprisingly well on data where this assumption does not hold."
