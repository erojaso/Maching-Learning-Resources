    "# How To Implement The Decision Tree Algorithm From Scratch In Python\n",
    "\n",
    "by Jason Brownlee on December 11, 2019.[Here](https://machinelearningmastery.com/implement-decision-tree-algorithm-scratch-python/) in [Code Algorithms From Scratch](https://machinelearningmastery.com/category/algorithms-from-scratch/). [Data](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication)\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are a powerful prediction method and extremely popular.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are popular because the final model is so easy to understand by practitioners and domain experts alike. The final __decision tree can explain exactly why a specific prediction was made, making it very attractive for operational use__.\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this tutorial, you will know:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to calculate and evaluate candidate split points in a data.\n",
    "- How to arrange splits into a decision tree structure.\n",
    "- How to apply the classification and regression tree algorithm to a real problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a binary decision tree is actually a process of dividing up the input space. A greedy approach is used to divide the space called recursive binary splitting. This is a numerical procedure where all the values are lined up and different split points are tried and tested using a cost function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Splitting continues until nodes contain a minimum number of training examples or a maximum tree depth is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Regression__: The cost function that is minimized to choose split points is the `sum squared error across all training samples` that fall within the rectangle.\n",
    "- __Classification__: The `Gini cost` function is used which provides an indication of how pure the nodes are, where node purity refers to how mixed the training data assigned to each node is.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tutorial\n",
    "This tutorial is broken down into 5 parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Gini Index.\n",

    "    - 2.1. Splitting a Dataset\n",
    "    - 2.2. Evaluating All Splits\n",

    "## 1. Gini Index\n",
    "The Gini index is the __name of the cost function used to evaluate splits in the dataset__.\n",
    "\n",
    "A split in the dataset involves one input attribute and one value for that attribute. It can be used to divide training patterns into two groups of rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "A __Gini score__ `gives an idea of how good a split is by how mixed the classes are in the two groups created by the split`. A perfect separation results in a Gini score of 0, whereas the worst case split that results in 50/50 classes in each group result in a Gini score of 0.5 (for a 2 class problem).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Demostration\n",
    "We have two groups of data with 2 rows in each group. The rows in the first group all belong to class 0 and the rows in the second group belong to class 1, so itâ€™s a perfect split.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $proportion = count(class_value) / count(rows)$\n",
    "\n",
    "The proportions for this example would be:\n",
    "```\n",
    "group_1_class_0 = 2 / 2 = 1\n",
    "group_1_class_1 = 0 / 2 = 0\n",
    "group_2_class_0 = 0 / 2 = 0\n",
    "group_2_class_1 = 2 / 2 = 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "Gini is then calculated for each child node as follows:\n",
    "- $gini_index = sum(proportion * (1.0 - proportion))$\n",
    "- $gini_index = 1.0 - sum(proportion * proportion)$\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gini index for each group must then be weighted by the size of the group, relative to all of the samples in the parent, e.g. all samples that are currently being grouped. We can add this weighting to the Gini calculation for a group as follows:\n",
    "- $gini_index = (1.0 - sum(proportion * proportion)) * (group_size/total_samples)$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example the Gini scores for each group are calculated as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Gini(group_1) = (1 - (1*1 + 0*0)) * 2/4\n",
    "Gini(group_1) = 0.0 * 0.5 \n",
    "Gini(group_1) = 0.0 \n",
    "Gini(group_2) = (1 - (0*0 + 1*1)) * 2/4\n",
    "Gini(group_2) = 0.0 * 0.5 \n",
    "Gini(group_2) = 0.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "The scores are then added across each child node at the split point to give a final Gini score for the split point that can be compared to other candidate split points."
